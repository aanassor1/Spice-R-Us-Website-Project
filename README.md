## Description 

This is a website built using Spring Boot to support a spice seller with an accounting system and membership-based online cookery recipes and advice. 

Spices R Us is a commercial spice supplier who want to move into the online household market. To facilitate this, we want to offer not just spice sales in small quantities, but also online recipe guidance and cooking tools. Spice R Us have a commercial accounts system, but also developed a householder accounts system, and the online support tools from scratch. 

## What I learnt
